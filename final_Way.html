					<h3>Comparing Earned Run Average and Win-Loss Percentage
					</h3>
					<p>Who is the best pitcher in Major League Baseball? This question seems so simple, but upon further investigation, it becomes evident that a simple answer is not exactly possible. Ask any Major League Baseball fan about the best pitchers in modern baseball, and Max Scherzer and Clayton Kershaw will be two names that are always involved in the conversation. However, it would be nearly impossible to get the entire baseball community to come to a consensus. For one thing, baseball fans are very passionate about their favorite teams and players, which leads to significant amounts of bias. Thus, the only true way to evaluate a question like this requires an unbiased method of analysis: statistics.</p>
					<p>Baseball is one of the most statistics driven sports in the world, so it only makes sense to use statistics to attempt to answer a question like this one, especially when avoiding bias is necessary. Since the invention of Statcast, advanced statistics get thrown into the face of every baseball fan that turns on the television. Although these statistics do provide in depth baseball analysis that was never possible before, sometimes it is easier to start with some of baseball’s most common stats.</p>
					<p>	Firstly, Earned Run Average (ERA) is commonly considered to be one of the best methods of evaluating a pitcher’s performance. In simplest terms, a pitcher’s goal is to prevent the other team from scoring runs. ERA determines how many runs a pitcher allows per nine innings on average. Therefore, ERA is one of the easiest ways to judge a pitcher’s effectiveness. Scherzer has a career ERA of 3.16, whereas Kershaw has a career ERA of 2.49. Furthermore, Scherzer has two seasons where his ERA was not above average, and Kershaw only has one. For reference, the average MLB ERA is usually around 4. Based on this statistic alone, Kershaw has Scherzer beat. However, there are other important factors to consider.</p>
					<p>Secondly, Win-Loss Percentage (W-L%) is another commonly used statistic to calculate a pitcher’s greatness. Outside of a pitcher’s main goal of preventing runs, the overarching goal of the whole game of baseball is to <i>win</i>. W-L% is the number of wins a pitcher earns divided by the total number of games in which they received the decision. Hence, W-L% is a great statistic for determining how often a pitcher helps their team win the game. Scherzer has an average W-L% of 0.617 over his career, and Kershaw has an average W-L% of 0.677 over his career. Once again, this statistic claims that Kershaw has been the more successful pitcher.</p>

				<h3>Longevity and Innings Pitched</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>At this point, it would seem obvious to most people that Clayton Kershaw has the edge over Max Scherzer based on ERA and W-L%, but there are other important factors aside from just sheer production. Another necessary point of discussion is a pitcher’s longevity. It is great for an organization if a pitcher maintains a low ERA and helps the team win games for a few seasons, but a pitcher becomes substantially more valuable if they are able to do that for a large amount of innings throughout the season, and for many seasons. In contrast with earlier examination, the numbers support Scherzer when it comes to longevity.</p>
					<p>Over his career, Scherzer has pitched 82 more innings than Kershaw in the same number of seasons. 82 innings is just over nine full games of pitching that Scherzer has been able to provide for his team where Kershaw would have already been removed from the game. This gives Scherzer added value, as he has been able to produce at a high level for more innings than Kershaw.</p>	
					<p>Additionally, Kershaw and Scherzer have both seen their ERA increase around the same time in their career. However, Scherzer is four years older than Kershaw, which indicates that he has been more effective than Kershaw in the years after his prime.</p>
					<p>Andy Kostka of “The Washington Times” stated, “now, though, as the years have gone by, Scherzer has maintained his dominance through another outlet: adaptability. As baseball changes around Scherzer each season, the 36-year-old changes along with it.”</p>
					<p>Scherzer has been able to adjust his strategy to accommodate his declining athleticism by increasing his technical skills and relying less on pure strength. This is a skill that Kershaw will have to develop if he wants to be as successful as Scherzer when he is 37 years old.</p>

					<h3>Analyzing Advanced Statistics</h3>
					<p>However, the three statistics discussed so far have their limitations. Baseball is one of the most numbers-driven sports in the world, so to only touch on three statistics would be naive. Additionally, factors such as longevity and total production are affected by player injury.</p>
					<p>Advanced statistics such as WAR, ERA+, and the variety of new statistics created by statcast are additional tools that experts use when analyzing player performance. Moreover, statistics like these are commonly cited by baseball fanatics, as evidenced by the selected comments from the subreddit r/baseball. WAR stands for Wins Above Replacement, and a player’s WAR represents how many more games their team won because of their performance. Over their careers, Kershaw has a WAR of about 5 games more than Scherzer. Similarly, ERA+ is an advanced statistic that takes a pitcher’s ERA and adjusts it to the entire league, by accounting for external factors such as defense and different ballparks. With the number 100 representing league average, Kershaw and Scherzer both have an above average career ERA+, with Kershaw’s ERA+ being 155, and Schezer’s being 134.</p>
					<p>However, it is possible to get too caught up in the advanced statistics and forget the basic numbers that are commonly used to assess a pitcher’s performance. Therefore, it is valuable to always start with basic statistics like ERA and W-L%.</p>

					<h3>Summary</h3>
					<p>Overall, it is difficult to determine whether or not Max Scherzer or Clayton Kershaw are the best pitcher in modern times, as there are too many factors involved to come to a proper conclusion.</p>
					<p>However, it is not a secret that Kershaw has been more valuable to one team than Scherzer has been, as Kershaw has played for just one team in his career and Scherzer has bounced around between five different organizations. How valuable a player is to their individual team is notable when evaluating a player’s career, but it should be emphasized that this factor is mostly out of the player’s control.</p>
					<p>Nonetheless, it is impossible to answer the question “who is the best pitcher in baseball?” without some type of bias. The findings prove that both Max Scherzer and Clayton Kershaw are two phenomenal pitchers in modern baseball. The statistics alone can paint a valuable picture, but they ultimately cannot make the final decision. With that, it is likely that this question will be debated by baseball fans forever.</p>
